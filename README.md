# water-quality-prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict multiple water quality parameters such as BOD, nitrates, and oxygen levels. By analyzing real-world water data, the model helps detect pollution early and supports better environmental decision-making. It turns complex chemical readings into clear, actionable insights for water safety.
